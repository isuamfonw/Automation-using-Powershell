<h><b>Introduction</b></h><br/>

In this task I created a PowerShell script. PowerShell enables administrators to perform administrative tasks on both local and remote systems. I applied scripting standards and used exception and exit handling where appropriate. The completed product prompted the user for input to complete various tasks until the user selects a prompt to exit the script.

Goal: Implementing tools that automate manual process for an orgaization.


Steps
- Created a PowerShell Script and named it prompts.ps1 within a folder name Requirments1
- Created a “switch” statement that continues to prompt a user by doing each of the following activities, until a user presses key 5:<br/>

- Using a regular expression, list files within the Requirements1 folder, with the .log file extension and redirect the results to a new file called “DailyLog.txt” within the same directory without overwriting existing data. Each time the user selects this prompt, the current date should precede the listing. (User presses key 1.)

- List the files inside the “Requirements1” folder in tabular format, sorted in ascending alphabetical order. Direct the output into a new file called “C916contents.txt” found in your “Requirements1” folder. (User presses key 2.)

- List the current CPU and memory usage. (User presses key 3.)

- List all the different running processes inside your system. Sort the output by virtual size used least to greatest, and display it in grid format. (User presses key 4.)

- Exit the script execution. (User presses key 5.)</ol>
